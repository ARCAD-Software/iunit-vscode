## Creating the Test Case in jUnit

> **Note**  
You can access the ARCAD iUnit menu only when you are connected to the AFS server using the Arcad iUnit extension.  
If that is not the case, use the ` ctrl+shift+p ` keyboard shortcut, enter **Connect to AFS Server** in the search field and continue with the next steps to connect.

In the JUnit mode, you can create a new JUnit Test Case by right-clicking on the Test Explorer and selecting the **Create Test Case** option.
